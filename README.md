##Business-Focused Sales Insights Project

*Task*:
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from different sources—customers, products, markets, transactions, and dates—to gain meaningful business insights.

*Approach*:
* Loaded and cleaned data using SQL (removed invalid records, converted currencies, fixed date formats).
* Created a relational database with foreign key links between tables.
* Added calculated fields like **estimated cost** and **profit**.
* Wrote SQL queries to analyze sales performance by customer, market, product, and month.

*End Result*:
* Identified top-performing customers, products, and markets.
* Found the best revenue months and total profit.
* Created a ready-to-use database and Power BI dashboard for easy decision-making.
